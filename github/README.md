when-rs is a rewrite of Perl utility [when](http://www.lightandmatter.com/when/when.html).

Please see the when utility's page to get a good idea of its functionality.

when-rs is a work in progress, and at the moment it only implements a subset of when's
functionality. It is also my first Rust project, so there are certainly things that
can be made better/simple/more idiomatic. Any comments, suggestions and PRs are welcome.
